                <h2>On the Subject of Clockworks</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The rules are the same as regular Clocks, except for the following changes. For a refresher of those rules, check out this video.</p>

                <p>Win a game of 6-player Clockworks, with knowledge of how your opponents are going to play. Use the cards at the bottom of the module to play them.</p>
                <h3>Clockworks, how to play:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each player is represented by a unique color.</li>
                    <li>Each player possesses a 0 card, a 1 card, and a special card which has a different effect for each color.</li>
                    <li>Each turn, every player plays a card at the same time.</li>
                    <li>The arrow in the center of the module will turn clockwise one position for each 1 card played (and special card effects will apply, if applicable).</li>
                    <li>At the end of the turn, the player the arrow is pointing at loses, and is removed from the game. Afterwards, the arrow turns clockwise to point to the next living player.</li>
                    <li>Special cards are removed from the game after they are played.</li>
                    <li>The last player standing wins.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Determining your opponents’ personalities:</h3>
                <p>Interpret the first two characters of the serial number as individual base-36 characters. Add these characters together, modulo the sum by 6, then add 1. Call this final number <var>n</var>. Assign the player in the bottom-left seat the personality associated with the <var>n</var>th character of the serial number. The next opponent clockwise gets the next character of the serial number (looping through the serial number if necessary) and so on, until the bottom-right player is assigned a personality. The remaining character is unused.</p>  
                <p>The next two tables will explain how each opponent will play.</p>
                <h4>Legend</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>C : The serial number character representing the specific opponent, considered as a base-36 number/li>
                    <li>L : The number of players that have not been removed from the game</li>
                    <li>% : Modulo operator (The result of a % b is the whole number remainder after dividing a by b)</li>
